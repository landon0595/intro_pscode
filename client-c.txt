# Client Task C #
# Add your pseudocode to this file below this line: #

Item === 1

if items in package === 2
   Continue to count packages in case
else 
   Do not add value of package to count

Items in case <= 100
    Can only be an even int
Case is 50 packages max

Items and cases can not be scanned
   Only packages can be be scanned
Item counter can only print even numbers 
   2 through 50

Each filled package that is scanned prints an added int of 2
Once int of 50 is reached the counter will reset back to the int 2
   The chorus from the song Celebration by Kool & The Gang will also play at an int count of 50 and then fade out.
There is no limit to the amount of filled cases in this current version of CaseFiller 

//Add update to include case counter
